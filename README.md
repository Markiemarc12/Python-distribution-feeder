# Python Distribution Feeder Modeling

This project is an educational Python implementation of a **synthetic distribution feeder power flow model**.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- Y-bus construction
- Power flow formulation
- PQ, PV, and slack bus behavior
- Iterative solution methods (Gauss–Seidel)

## Disclaimer
This project uses **synthetic and anonymized data** created for educational purposes only.
It does **not** represent any real utility system or operational asset.

## Features
- Y-bus construction from line impedance data
- Gauss–Seidel iterative power flow solver
- Support for PQ, PV, and slack buses
- Basic result analysis and diagnostics

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 

## Status
Work in progress — continuing to add features and improve structure.
